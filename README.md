# If These Walls Could Speak

This was my submission for the 1 month long game jam Ostara 2024: https://itch.io/jam/ostara-games-for-spring-2024

For this project, I challenged myself to model everything in the game myself. I achieved that.
It was a lot of fun and I'm hopiong to polish this up a little bit in the future so its completely bug free


### Known Bugs
- Crouch is way too low
- You can crouch then hide and clip under the map
- Grandma can have errors and get stuck in place
